# Notes

### Notes on things that I find interesting and dont want to forget!
##### (and I don't want to have a blog)

This is divided in to topics/folders, sub topics when needed, some source files may be added as needed.

ps: I'm dyslexic so ignore the obviuse spealings mistakes..   
pps: Some of the topics are incomplete a lot of times as I *sometimes* when i sart learning something new forget to fully document it all..
